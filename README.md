# List of Projects
This repository contains projects that I have completed independently in Python. 
Each project has a brief write-up here and a more detailed "Overview" page in its respective folder
## Poker Bot
Create a tool that will provide insight into poker strategy and analytics while playing online.
Determining the best action at any given game state in poker requires a mixture of memorization and quick mental math. This program aims to reduce the need for these difficult methods and simplifies the decision process

## Fantasy Football Predictor (refined)
rebuilt old fantasy football predictor with focus on functions and flexibility. <br>
build function to import data.  This will ensure that the dataframe used in each stage of the project is directly from the source data. <br>
Created function to run random forest classifiers with variable parameters. <br>
Built flexible neural network from scratch.  with the ability to adjust layer parameters.  

## Fantasy Football Predictor (ARCHIVED)
create a model to predict fantasy football outcomes.  <br>
explored possible predictive tools for wide recievers <br>
Attempted linear regression, clustering and random forest models. <br>
Models seemed to become corrupted with data leaks.  Program became bulky and inflexible.  Chose to archive existing work and rebuild more programatically.  Will bring most successful model (random forest) into new updated notebook.
