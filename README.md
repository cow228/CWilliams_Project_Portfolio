# List of Projects
This repository contains projects that I have completed independently in Python. 
Each project has a brief write-up here and a more detailed "Overview" page in its respective folder

## Fantasy Football Predictor
[Currently Being Refactored in 'nfl-pipeline']
Refactoring to use python scripts and makefiles
Goal is to make pipeline more flexible for reusability
Goal is to make the code easier to use rather than scrolling through large Jupyter notebook

Build Model to predict fantasy football points per game for wide recievers. <br>
Build function to import data in usable format. <br>
Explore data. <br>
Model with linear regression, random forest and neural network. <br>
Compare predictions to randomized trials of drafts based on average draft position.

## Data Mining Pipeline
Code to automatically handle most phases of data mining <br>
1) Preprocessing
2) Feature selection
3) Model selection

## Quantifying NFL Head Coach Quality
Data minning school project with poster presentation.  <br>
Goal of project was to identify ways to quantify the quality of NFL head coaches.  The method ultimatley selected was to create predictors for head coach contract renewal as a stand in for "good" coaches.  The features of the model most predictive of contract renewal can be considered viable quantifiers of coach quality. <br>
The goal is to use these predictors for further analysis going forward

## Poker Bot
Create a tool that will provide insight into poker strategy and analytics while playing online.
Determining the best action at any given game state in poker requires a mixture of memorization and quick mental math. This program aims to reduce the need for these difficult methods and simplifies the decision process
